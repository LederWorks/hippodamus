## Release Process

Releases are handled automatically:

1. **Version Calculation**: GitVersion calculates the next version based on commit messages
2. **Automated Builds**: GitHub Actions builds for all platforms
3. **Automated Releases**: Releases are created automatically for version tags
4. **Changelog**: Updated automatically based on conventional commits

### Commit Message Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automatic versioning:

- `feat:` - New features (minor version bump)
- `fix:` - Bug fixes (patch version bump)
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

For breaking changes, add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit body or use `!` after the type:
```
feat!: redesign provider API

BREAKING CHANGE: Provider interface has changed
```
